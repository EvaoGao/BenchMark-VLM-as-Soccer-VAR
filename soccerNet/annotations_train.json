        "answer": "A yellow card. The defender has no intention of passing the ball and only hits the opponent's feet from behind with moderate intensity. Such behavior shows a lack of consideration for the well-being of his opponent, and therefore this action should be considered reckless. The player should be punished with a yellow card."

In this case, it is more advantageous for the team to receive a free kick, as they do not have a promising attack. Continuing the game does not benefit the team, as the position of the foul is far from the goal and there"

The position of the offense is likely central on the field and the attacker is moving towards the opposing goal, but he is far from the goal and too many defenders can still intervene.

In this case, it is more advantageous for the team to receive a free kick, as they do not have a promising attack. Continuing the game does not benefit the team, as the position of the foul is far from the goal"

Continuing the game would not benefit the team, as the foul was committed far from the goal and there"

Although the intensity was moderate, there was no intention to harm the opponent and the risk of injury for the fouled player was low. Furthermore, the defender tried to play the ball and therefore no card is the right decision."

The intensity is very slight, but this type of action could be considered a lack of respect for the game and result in a warning. Since it is an insignificant play that does not prevent a goal, I do not"
